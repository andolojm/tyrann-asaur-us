            <p>
                I’m a software engineer who enjoys the full scope of creative and technical work.
                From development of all sorts, to UX and design, or solution architecture and security.
                I’m best suited for full-stack work but open to anything I can set my mind to figuring out.

            </a>
            <p>
                I’ve worked on projects such as Hershey’s industry-leading SmartLabel implementation,
                and a reporting platform that centralizes scattered, enterprise-scale data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve led User Experience consultations with projects of all sizes,
                and implemented massive web performance improvements (secret method: I used very basic industry best practices).
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I’m committed to volunteering for the Alfred State Information Security Team.
                This includes building vulnerable applications, servers, or networks,
                guiding current students, and hosting information security competitions.
                I also apparently enjoy hunting for dinsoaur-themed domain names.

                I’m not the most active GitHub contributor, but I’m aiming to change
                that once in a while through personal projects like this site.
                Check out some of my work!

                I enjoy working with a diverse set of technologies.
                I’m always open to pick up a new stack or build out prototypes using the flashy new tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                My current favorite stack includes a React.js or React Native frontend,
                as well as a Python Flask (for simple projects) or Grails (for complex projects) backend with any SQL database.

                I’m also not the most active writer, but I have a few good pieces that
                explain my typical process and how I approach problems.
